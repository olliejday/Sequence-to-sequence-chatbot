# Sequence-to-sequence-chatbot
An end to end system to map input sequences to output sequences of different lengths. Here trained to develop a chatbot model. A ‘query’ is input to the GRU RNN which encodes the input to a fixed dimension vector, this is in turn input into a decoder GRU RNN which outputs the ‘response’.
